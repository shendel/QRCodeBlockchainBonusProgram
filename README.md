IMPORTANT Update to Developer Terms

Dear Alexander, you're receiving this message because you are the developer of xxxxx, xxxxx.

On January 21, 2025, Telegram updated its Terms of Service for Bot Developers (https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers#7-blockchain-integration) and published new guidelines (https://core.telegram.org/bots/blockchain-guidelines) for mini apps that choose to integrate blockchain technology or promote such mini apps.

These changes were made to ensure that blockchain-based mini apps provide a uniform experience and meet the speed, reliability and security standards of Telegram and its users.

The updated terms (https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers#7-blockchain-integration) require that mini apps on the Telegram platform:

1. Exclusively use the TON Blockchain for the creation and distribution of cryptocurrency tokens or blockchain assets.
2. Only interact with cryptocurrency wallets connected by the TON Connect SDK (other protocols are permitted for bridging assets from other blockchains).
3. Do not promote cryptocurrency wallets, unless such wallets are based on the TON blockchain, exclusively use TON Connect for interactions with apps, and primarily provide services related to the TON blockchain.

See the Terms of Service (https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers#7-blockchain-integration) and guidelines (https://core.telegram.org/bots/blockchain-guidelines) for the full details.

Required Changes

To maintain uninterrupted access for Telegram users, there is a grace period during which developers can make the necessary updates to their mini apps. However, clause 7.1 (https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers#7-1-issuing-assets) is effective immediately.

- If your app generates or distributes blockchain assets that are not on the TON blockchain, it must immediately stop and begin using only the TON blockchain.

- If your app interfaces with or functions as a wallet, it must exclusively use TON Connect for all interactions by February 1, 2025.

- If your app promotes any cryptocurrency wallets or platforms that do not meet the new requirements (https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers#7-4-promotion), it must remove references to these services by February 1, 2025.

- If your app operates on other blockchains, it must transition to TON by February 21, 2025. This includes bridging existing assets, migrating smart contracts, and exclusively utilizing TON Connect. If you wish to contact us about transitioning to TON, please send a message with the tag #MigrationToTON to @BotSupport (https://t.me/BotSupport).

If you do NOT have mini apps, or your mini apps are NOT blockchain based and do NOT promote blockchain-related apps, this change does not affect you.

See the Terms of Service (https://telegram.org/tos/bot-developers#7-blockchain-integration) and guidelines (https://core.telegram.org/bots/blockchain-guidelines) for the full details.
